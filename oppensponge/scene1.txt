**Oppenheimer 2: Spongebob's Curse**

**Scene 1: Unexpected Arrival**

---

*Location: The Manhattan Project facility. Large scientific equipment and computers are spread throughout. Scientists bustle about, immersed in their work. A mysterious portal opens in a corner of the facility, unnoticed by the scientists.*

**Sound Effect:** Whirling of the portal, a blend of undersea bubbles and wind.

**SpongeBob and Patrick emerge from the portal, looking dazed and confused. Their appearance immediately contrasts with the seriousness of the facility. They're in their typical outfits, but both are holding onto pieces of seaweed, likely what they were using or playing with when the portal grabbed them.**

**SpongeBob:** *(Blinking)* "Whoa, Patrick! That wasn't the wormhole to the Jellyfish Fields!"
 
**Patrick:** *(Rubbing his head, looking around)* "It's... so... dry here. And where's the water?"

*SpongeBob looks down and realizes they are indeed out of water.*

**SpongeBob:** "Patrick! We're... breathing... air! Real air!"

**Patrick:** "Tastes weird. But look at this place, SpongeBob!"

*SpongeBob and Patrick start to gawk at the equipment around them. SpongeBob approaches a complicated-looking device.*

**SpongeBob:** "Ooh, shiny! Do you think it makes Krabby Patties, Patrick?"

**Patrick:** *(Eyes wide)* "Maybe it's a new ice cream machine! You know, for those above-sea flavors!"

*As they wander and touch things, a clipboard-carrying scientist named Dr. Thompson notices them.*

**Dr. Thompson:** *(Dumbfounded)* "What on Earth? How did you two get in here?"

**SpongeBob:** "Well, there was this whirlpool, and then... here we are!"

**Patrick:** "Are you the ice cream man?"

**Dr. Thompson:** *(Sighs)* "Security!"

*As security officers rush towards them, SpongeBob and Patrick, with innocent curiosity, continue to explore the room, accidentally activating a few machines, causing minor comedic chaos like beeping alarms and flashing lights.*

**Security Officer:** "Who are you two? And what are you doing here?"

**SpongeBob:** "I'm SpongeBob SquarePants, and this is Patrick Star. We're... uh... tourists?"

**Patrick:** *(Proudly)* "From Bikini Bottom!"

*The scene ends with SpongeBob and Patrick being apprehended by the security officers, looking bewildered but still amusingly cheerful.*

**Cut to Scene 2.**
