Oppenheimer 2: Spongebob's Curse**

**Scene 4: Unscientific Shenanigans**

---

*Location: The main research lab of the Manhattan Project facility. Several scientists are gathered around a large table, discussing the intricate details of the bomb design. A big chalkboard shows complex calculations.*

**Dr. Thompson:** "Gentlemen, this is our most critical phase. We cannot afford mistakes. Precision is the key."

**Scientist 1 (Dr. Clark):** "Agreed. The latest simulations show a promising yield, but we need to—"

*The conversation is interrupted by a loud bang. SpongeBob and Patrick have inadvertently knocked over a stand containing test tubes.*

**Patrick:** "Oops... Did I do that?"

**SpongeBob:** *(Giggling)* "It's like bowling, but... science-y."

*Dr. Thompson glares at them, trying to control his anger.*

**Dr. Thompson:** "Who let them back in?!"

**Security Officer:** "They said they were part of the inspection team... and... they had those coats on."

*SpongeBob and Patrick are now seen wearing oversized lab coats, clearly not fitting them.*

**SpongeBob:** "Look, Patrick! I'm a scientist! Eureka!"

**Patrick:** "Eureka? I thought we were in the dry place."

*Scientist 2 (Dr. Martinez) tries to get things back on track.*

**Dr. Martinez:** "Ignore them. Let's focus. We were discussing the isotope enrichment—"

*Suddenly, a machine starts whirring loudly. Patrick is seen poking it with a stick.*

**Patrick:** "Look! It's purring!"

**Dr. Clark:** "That's a centrifuge! Turn it off!"

**SpongeBob:** *(Rushing over, eager to help but clueless)* "Which button? This one? Or this? Oh, maybe it's this big red one!"

*More machines start going haywire. Bells ring, lights flash, and papers fly.*

**Scientist 3 (Dr. Kapoor):** "That's it! I can't work like this! I’m out."

*Dr. Kapoor leaves in a huff, followed by another scientist.*

**Scientist 4 (Dr. Liu):** "Between world politics and... this? I need a vacation."

*Dr. Thompson takes a deep breath.*

**Dr. Thompson:** "I will have them removed immediately."

**Patrick:** "Is it lunchtime yet?"

**SpongeBob:** "I could really go for a Krabby Patty!"

*Scene fades as SpongeBob and Patrick discuss their favorite foods, oblivious to the chaos around them.*

**Cut to Scene 5.**
