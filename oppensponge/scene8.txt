**Oppenheimer 2: Spongebob's Curse**

**Scene 8: The Unthinkable**

---

*Location: SpongeBob's Neighborhood in Bikini Bottom. The scene is tranquil. Schools of fish pass by in the distance, jellyfish float peacefully, and bubbles rise from various locations. SpongeBob's pineapple house stands proudly.*

**Sound Effect:** Gentle undersea ambiance – bubbles, distant whale calls, and soft currents.

*SpongeBob and Patrick are in the front yard, attempting to reconstruct the portal device using miscellaneous undersea items like shells, seaweed, and coral. Their understanding of the device is obviously flawed.*

**SpongeBob:** "Okay, Patrick, just one more coral piece and we should be good to go!"

**Patrick:** *(Giggling)* "I still can't believe they let us take this thing back with us. Maybe it's a souvenir!"

**SpongeBob:** "Well, after all that chaos, I think they were just glad to see us leave."

*Just then, there's an ominous rumbling. The entire scene darkens, and a chilling wind picks up.*

**Patrick:** *(Looking up, scared)* "SpongeBob? What's that?"

*The sky – or rather, the water above them – seems to part. A dark object falls rapidly toward Bikini Bottom.*

**SpongeBob:** *(Eyes wide in horror)* "PATRICK! INSIDE! NOW!"

*But it's too late. A blinding flash engulfs everything. The shockwave from the explosion sweeps across Bikini Bottom, toppling houses and uprooting corals.*

**Sound Effect:** Thunderous explosion, followed by a roaring shockwave.

*When the light fades, we see devastation. The iconic pineapple house is obliterated. All that remains is smoldering debris. SpongeBob and Patrick are thrown to a distant corner, dazed and disoriented.*

**Patrick:** *(Coughing)* "Wha... what happened?"

**SpongeBob:** *(Tears forming)* "My house... Gary..."

*In the distance, the unmistakable silhouette of an atomic mushroom cloud rises. The devastation is clear. Houses flattened, familiar locations destroyed.*

**Patrick:** "It looks like... that bomb thingy they were talking about..."

**SpongeBob:** *(Crying)* "Why...? Why here...? Why us?"

*The scene concludes with SpongeBob on his knees amidst the debris, crying out for Gary, while Patrick sits nearby, too shocked to speak.*

**Cut to Scene 9.**
