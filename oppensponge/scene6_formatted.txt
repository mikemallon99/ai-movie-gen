Setting: A dimly lit room inside the Manhattan Project facility. An echo of obsession and fatigue fills the air, with scientific blueprints spread out across the table, instruments carelessly strewn, and a chalkboard marked with unfathomable equations. Through a large window, the barren landscape of the desert night imparts an eerie calm.
