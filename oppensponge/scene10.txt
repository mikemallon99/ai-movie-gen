**Oppenheimer 2: Spongebob's Curse**

**Scene 10: The Aftermath**

---

*Location: Ruins of SpongeBob's pineapple house. The ash and remnants from the explosion scatter around. A faint outline of the once iconic pineapple lies on the seafloor.*

*The scene opens with a close-up of SpongeBob's face, tears streaming down. Behind him, bubbles rise from the devastation. The usual vibrant atmosphere of Bikini Bottom looks dulled and muted.*

**SpongeBob:** *(Whispered, choked up)* "Gary..."

*There's a rustling, and Oppenheimer emerges from the dust, coughing slightly. He's wearing a modified diving suit, allowing him to be underwater. He observes the destruction, his expression heavy with remorse.*

**Oppenheimer:** "This... This wasn't supposed to happen. Not like this."

**SpongeBob:** *(Turning to face him, anger and sorrow evident)* "You did this. You took everything from me."

**Oppenheimer:** *(Hesitant)* "I... I didn't know about your home... about Gary. I was blinded by my rage and ambition."

*Silence fills the scene for a moment. The only sound is the mournful wail of a distant conch shell.*

**Patrick:** *(From a distance, shouting)* "SpongeBob! I found something!"

*SpongeBob and Oppenheimer turn to see Patrick holding a small, damaged shell. SpongeBob rushes over, taking the shell from Patrick's hand. A tiny meow is heard.*

**SpongeBob:** *(Tears of relief)* "Gary! You're alive!"

*The small snail, a little scorched but otherwise okay, emerges from the shell and cuddles into SpongeBob's embrace.*

**Oppenheimer:** *(Softly, to himself)* "Some small mercy..."

**SpongeBob:** *(Facing Oppenheimer again, holding Gary protectively)* "This destruction... it's not just about my home or Gary. It's about the choices we make and the consequences we have to live with."

**Oppenheimer:** "You're right. And I have to live with this. I hope, in time, you can find it in your heart to forgive me."

*The scene closes with SpongeBob and Oppenheimer staring at each other, the weight of their actions and choices palpable. A delicate balance of anger, understanding, and hope for redemption hangs in the water between them.*

**Cut to Narrator's voiceover.**
