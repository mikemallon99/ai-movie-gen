**Oppenheimer 2: Spongebob's Curse**

**Scene 2: Interrogation and Introduction**

---

*Location: A simple, clean room within the Manhattan Project facility, likely meant for meetings. A large wooden table sits in the center. SpongeBob and Patrick are seated on one side, looking around in innocent wonder. Opposite them are Dr. Thompson, Oppenheimer, and a couple of other scientists. Security officers stand near the door.*

**Dr. Thompson:** *(Pointing at SpongeBob and Patrick)* "Found these two messing around in the lab. They just appeared out of nowhere."

**Oppenheimer:** *(Squinting at SpongeBob and Patrick)* "What are they? Some sort of aquatic... entities?"

**SpongeBob:** *(Waving)* "Hi there! I'm SpongeBob, and this is my buddy, Patrick!"

**Patrick:** *(Saluting with his starfish arm)* "Hello, dry people!"

*Oppenheimer, trying to maintain his composure and seriousness, clears his throat.*

**Oppenheimer:** "How exactly did you two get into a top-secret facility?"

**SpongeBob:** "It was a big swirly thing! Super fun. Felt like Jellyfish Fields on a windy day."

**Patrick:** "Yeah, and then we were here. In the not-wet place."

**Oppenheimer:** "This is a secure location. We are working on projects of great importance here."

**SpongeBob:** *(Curiously)* "Like... Krabby Patties?"

**Patrick:** "Or secret ice cream flavors?"

*Dr. Thompson rolls his eyes.*

**Dr. Thompson:** "No, not ice cream. Listen, you two need to leave."

**SpongeBob:** "We'd love to! But... how do we get back to Bikini Bottom?"

**Oppenheimer:** *(Rubbing his temples)* "Bikini what?"

**Patrick:** "Bikini Bottom! It's our home! With Squidward, and the Krusty Krab, and Jellyfish Fields..."

*SpongeBob nods enthusiastically.*

**Oppenheimer:** "Okay, okay. Look, we'll try to figure out how to send you back. But until then, you can't touch anything or disrupt our work. Understand?"

**SpongeBob and Patrick:** *(Saluting together)* "Aye aye, captain!"

*Oppenheimer sighs, realizing this may be more complicated than he thought.*

**Cut to Scene 3.**
