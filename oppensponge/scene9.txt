**Oppenheimer 2: Spongebob's Curse**

**Scene 9: Aftermath**

---

*Location: The remains of SpongeBob's pineapple house. There's a scorched landscape with a few remnants of the familiar underwater surroundings. The aftermath of the explosion is apparent - the iconic pineapple house is now nothing more than debris. Smoky bubbles rise from the ground, and the scene has a somber hue.*

*SpongeBob stands amidst the wreckage, tears filling his eyes as he clutches a small piece of the burnt pineapple.*

**SpongeBob:** *(Voice breaking)* "My home... Gary... Everything's gone..."

**Patrick:** *(Looking around)* "I... I don't understand, SpongeBob. Why would someone do this?"

*From the smoke, Oppenheimer walks forward, guilt evident in his posture and expression. He approaches slowly, taking in the devastation.*

**Oppenheimer:** "I... I didn't think it would come to this."

*SpongeBob, hearing Oppenheimer, turns around with tearful fury.*

**SpongeBob:** "YOU! You did this! Why?!"

**Oppenheimer:** *(Hesitating)* "It was never about you, SpongeBob. It was about proving a point, about showing strength. But... I've lost myself."

**Patrick:** "You took away his home! Our memories! Our joy!"

**Oppenheimer:** "I... I can't change what's been done. I wish I could. I'm sorry."

**SpongeBob:** *(Falling to his knees)* "Sorry won't bring back Gary. Sorry won't bring back my home."

**Oppenheimer:** *(Crouching down, putting a hand on SpongeBob's shoulder)* "I know. But we can try to rebuild, make amends."

*SpongeBob, looking up at him, tears streaming down, slowly nods.*

**SpongeBob:** "It's not about the house. It's about the home, the memories. And that... That's something you can never destroy."

*Oppenheimer and SpongeBob share a moment of understanding as they take in the gravity of their actions and the aftermath.*

**Cut to Scene 10.**
