**Oppenheimer 2: Spongebob's Curse**

**Scene 6: Obsession & Determination**

---

*Location: A dimly lit room inside the Manhattan Project facility. There are blueprints spread out on the table, scientific instruments everywhere, and a chalkboard filled with equations. A large window shows the desert night outside.*

**Sound Effect:** Ominous, tense music builds in the background.

*The camera pans over the blueprints, revealing intricate designs of what appears to be the atomic bomb. There are scribbles, notes, and corrections all over.*

*Oppenheimer is at the center of the room, deeply engrossed in his work. His appearance is disheveled, indicating days of relentless work. As he sketches and calculates, his hands tremble slightly.*

**Oppenheimer (murmuring to himself):** "I'll show him... I'll show them all..."

*There's a montage of Oppenheimerâ€™s obsession:*

- He's shown pouring over books and documents, sometimes frustratedly throwing them aside.
  
- Oppenheimer conducts experiments, causing small explosions, sometimes hurting himself but quickly getting back to work.
  
- He engages in heated discussions with other scientists, some leaving in disagreement or fear.
  
- Alone, he's seen with a replica of the bomb, talking to it as if it's an old friend or a child.

**Oppenheimer (whispering to the bomb replica):** "You and I... we'll change the world."

*At one point, Oppenheimer gazes at a picture of SpongeBob and Patrick, taken from security footage.*

**Oppenheimer (in a low voice):** "You think I'm a monster? I'll show you true power..."

*The montage reaches its peak with Oppenheimer triumphant, holding a finalized blueprint.*

**Oppenheimer:** "It's done... The world's most powerful weapon..."

*He takes a deep breath, staring out into the night, realizing the weight of his creation.*

**Sound Effect:** The music climaxes and then fades.

**Cut to Scene 7.**
