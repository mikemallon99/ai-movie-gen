**Oppenheimer 2: Spongebob's Curse**

**Scene 7: Before the Storm**

---

*Location: SpongeBob's iconic pineapple house in Bikini Bottom. Inside, the living room is warmly lit. SpongeBob and Patrick sit on the couch, both with a glass of kelp juice. They look slightly worn out but still cheerful, reminiscing about their unexpected adventure.*

**SpongeBob:** "That was quite an adventure, wasn't it, buddy? One moment we're chasing jellyfish, and the next we're in... wherever that was."

**Patrick:** "Yeah, with all those shiny machines and that really angry guy! But at least we're back home."

*SpongeBob takes a sip of his kelp juice, a thoughtful look on his face.*

**SpongeBob:** "You know, Patrick, I couldn't help but feel there was something more going on in that place. Something... bigger than jellyfishing or Krusty Krab."

**Patrick:** "You mean like a bigger ice cream machine?"

**SpongeBob:** *(Sighing)* "No, Patrick. I felt a... heaviness. Like they were working on something that could change everything."

**Patrick:** *(Confused)* "Change? Like a new flavor of ice cream?"

**SpongeBob:** "No, Patrick. I mean, I think they were making something dangerous."

*There's a brief pause as the two look at each other, sensing the gravity of the situation.*

**Patrick:** "But... why would they make something dangerous?"

**SpongeBob:** "I don't know, buddy. Sometimes people do things without thinking about the consequences."

**Patrick:** "You mean like when I ate that triple-layered kelp cake and couldn't move for a week?"

**SpongeBob:** *(Giggling)* "Exactly like that!"

*The two laugh for a moment, their signature laughter filling the room. But the laughter dies down, replaced by an uneasy silence. They look at each other, sensing that their adventure had somehow touched on something much bigger and darker.*

**SpongeBob:** "Let's just be glad we're back home, safe and sound."

**Patrick:** "Yeah, home sweet pineapple."

*SpongeBob takes a moment to appreciate his home, looking around fondly.*

**SpongeBob:** "No matter what happens out there, Patrick, at least we have each other and our home here in Bikini Bottom."

*The two share a heartfelt moment, with Patrick nodding in agreement. They toast their glasses of kelp juice to "home," unaware of the impending destruction that awaits.*
