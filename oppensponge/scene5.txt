**Oppenheimer 2: Spongebob's Curse**

**Scene 5: Confrontation and Realization**

---

*Location: Oppenheimer's office - a dimly lit room filled with blueprints, books, and models of atomic structures. There's a large wooden desk in the center. A couple of chairs sit on one side, while Oppenheimer's chair is behind the desk. The atmosphere is heavy.*

*Oppenheimer sits at his desk, visibly agitated. The door slams open. SpongeBob and Patrick are pushed inside by security officers.*

**Security Officer:** "Sir, we found them meddling in the labs."

**Oppenheimer:** *(Taking a deep breath)* "Leave us."

*The security officers nod and exit, closing the door behind them.*

**SpongeBob:** "Hi! I'm SpongeBob, and this is my best friend, Patrick. We didn't mean to cause any trouble. We just sort of... ended up here."

**Oppenheimer:** "Your recklessness could've had catastrophic consequences!"

**Patrick:** *(Looking around, curiously)* "Cat-a-what?"

**SpongeBob:** "We're really sorry, sir. We just thought it was a fancy ice cream place or something."

**Oppenheimer:** "This is far from an ice cream parlor! This is a place where history is being made, where we're crafting the future!"

*SpongeBob tilts his head, puzzled.*

**SpongeBob:** "Crafting? Like arts and crafts?"

**Oppenheimer:** *(Exhales heavily, attempting to calm himself)* "No... We're building something... powerful."

**Patrick:** "Like a magic wand?"

*Oppenheimer stands up abruptly, pointing a gun at SpongeBob.*

**Oppenheimer:** "You've sabotaged crucial work here. This isn't a playground!"

**SpongeBob:** *(Holding up his hands, eyes wide but still maintaining an air of innocence)* "We didn't know! And... umm... pointing that thing at people isn't very nice!"

**Patrick:** *(Nervously)* "Yeah, and it's definitely not an ice cream scoop..."

**Oppenheimer:** *(Voice shaking with frustration)* "You... you motherf-"

**SpongeBob:** *(Interrupting, surprisingly stern)* "We might be from a different world, but we know when someone's trying to do something that might hurt others. And this place feels... dangerous."

**Patrick:** *(Nods)* "Yeah, not jellyfishing-friendly at all."

**SpongeBob:** "Your big words and machines don't scare us. We've faced the Alaskan Bull Worm, the evil Man Ray, and even the Bubble Poppin' Boys!"

**Oppenheimer:** *(Lowering the gun, taken aback)* "What are you even talking about?"

**SpongeBob:** *(With conviction)* "I don't know what you're building here, but if it's as bad as it feels, maybe you should think twice before continuing."

*Oppenheimer seems to consider SpongeBob's words for a moment, then shakes his head.*

**Oppenheimer:** "You don't understand. This is bigger than you can comprehend."

**SpongeBob:** "Maybe, but remember, every big problem in the ocean started as a small ripple."

*With a thoughtful look on his face, Oppenheimer motions for them to leave.*

**Oppenheimer:** "Go... before I change my mind."

*SpongeBob and Patrick quickly exit the room, but not before SpongeBob offers a last piece of advice.*

**SpongeBob:** "If you ever want to visit Bikini Bottom, leave the pointy thing behind. We prefer jellyfish nets."
