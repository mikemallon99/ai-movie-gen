**Oppenheimer 2: Spongebob's Curse**

**Scene 3: Tour of Trouble**

---

*Location: The main laboratory within the Manhattan Project facility. There's a flurry of activity, with scientists moving around, discussing, and taking notes. Large machinery whirs and beeps. It's a symphony of science.*

**Oppenheimer:** *(Addressing a small group of scientists)* "Keep a close eye on our... guests. We can't afford any disruptions."

**Scientist 1:** "Do we even know what they are?"

**Scientist 2:** "Some sort of sea creatures, I assume?"

**SpongeBob:** *(Eagerly)* "Oooh! Can we get a tour? This place looks even more fun than the Glove World amusement park!"

**Patrick:** *(Rubbing his belly)* "Do you have any food? I'm starving!"

*Dr. Thompson, trying to keep things controlled, interjects.*

**Dr. Thompson:** "Alright, alright. I'll give you two a brief tour. But remember, no touching anything!"

**SpongeBob:** "Don't worry, we promise to be on our best behavior."

**Patrick:** "I'll try."

*As they move around the lab, SpongeBob and Patrick are mesmerized by the equipment and technology.*

**SpongeBob:** *(Pointing at a large machine)* "What does that one do?"

**Dr. Thompson:** "That's an early form of computer. We use it for complex calculations."

**Patrick:** "It looks like a big typewriter. But with more lights."

*SpongeBob approaches another station with test tubes filled with colorful liquids.*

**SpongeBob:** "Ooh! Are these different flavors of bubble soap?"

**Scientist 3:** *(Panicking)* "Don't touch that! It's a highly reactive compound!"

*Patrick is seen staring at a complex diagram on a blackboard.*

**Patrick:** "This looks like when I try to connect the dots. But... messier."

*Dr. Thompson is trying his best to manage their curiosity, but it's evident he's getting overwhelmed.*

**Dr. Thompson:** "Okay, that's enough of the tour. Let's head back to the meeting room."

**SpongeBob:** *(Cheerfully)* "Thank you for showing us around! It's been a... enlightening experience."

**Patrick:** "Yeah, lots of blinky things!"

*As they walk away, one of the machines SpongeBob had been close to starts beeping erratically.*

**Scientist 4:** "What did they do?!"

**Dr. Thompson:** *(Alarmed)* "I thought I said no touching!"

**SpongeBob:** "I swear I didn't touch anything! Well, maybe just a tiny nudge..."

*The lab turns chaotic as scientists rush to stabilize the machines and equipment. SpongeBob and Patrick, clueless about the gravity of the situation, continue to look around in wonder.*

**Cut to Scene 4.**
